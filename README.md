# NinjaUtils

A heavily inspired take on [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/), with all the same features + extra, done from scratch in my own way with mild reference to it.
TriggerTools.cs is taken directly from [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/) (Not including some edits), all credit goes to that and its creator(s).
