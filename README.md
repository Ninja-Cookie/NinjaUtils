# NinjaUtils

A heavily inspired take on [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/), with most of the same features, minus showing triggers, updated and made a little better.

New things include:
- Ability to save velocity when saving position.
- Being able to set specific position values for saved location.
- A heavily improves fly mechanic.
- A noclip mechanic.
- Teleport hopping between spawns.
- Teleport hopping between dream spawns.
- Ability to apply dynamic FPS values to lock at.
- Toggle Mouse.

This was created from scratch, with mild reference to [SpeedUtils](https://github.com/realJomoko/SpeedUtils/) on how some things are done, so the code and structure aint as pretty, but it works.
